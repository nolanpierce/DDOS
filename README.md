# Remote Access Tool - Python
###  This is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY 
### I am not responsible for the things you may do with this I made it to learn and hope others can learn from it too
## ABOUT:
### This is a project that is targeted towards back dooring. HEHE not that backdoor
### I have a series of attacks and other goodies im going to be putting in a second repo if they arent included into this project for example (Keylogger, cookie Scraper, DDOS, etc)
### This project will not be maintained but it will eventually be rewrote in c++ because I want to be able to challenge myself and also make something that doesnt require python to work
